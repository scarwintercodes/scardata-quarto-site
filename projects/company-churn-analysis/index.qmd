## Context

In March 2024 I consulted an early education tech (edutech) company to help their engagement team learn more about churn trends and actionable steps to reduce it.

## Challenge

1.  What metrics would you recommend the engagement team track to monitor churn?
2.  What are the key insights from the data?
3.  The company is aiming to reduce churn by 20% over the next year. Based on the data provided, what strategies would you recommend?

## Solution

This [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m7MQeXpGnzxUnlaGeJrGRPty_HFwiiTKbGbs-l_MQ00/edit?usp=drive_link) outlines the analysis I provided for 3 hours of work, including industry-specific research.
