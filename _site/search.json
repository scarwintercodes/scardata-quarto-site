Furthermore, many rural residents cannot readily transport themselves to a hospital or shelter. In many cases, these residents are often too sick to drive themselves. If they have a designated family member or friend who can transport them, they would have to ensure the roads are clear for vehicles to pass through, which is all the more difficult during a natural disaster."
